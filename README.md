# Obesity_brain_age_prediction

The following notebooks have been used to analyze pre-processed neuroimaging data in the article 
"Obesity accelerates brain ageing: a multimodal imaging study". 
In particular, resting state fMRI-derived measures (intra- and inter-connectivity), Gray Matter volume, 
and White Matter integrity measures have been used to predict age and the obesity status using a 
machine learning approach.
